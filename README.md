  Brainless is a personal description of the following collection of pages;
  without a purpose, it feels `brainless`. Meant to be a source for self
  reference, open to the public. WYSIWYG.

# What is this?

This collection of markdown and other documents constitute a representative collection of my knowledge. Externally, this serves as a lasting resource which documents the learning process for a variety of engineering courses as well as my personal process for working on whatever project is at hand. Additionally, it serves as a method of reclaiming social media as I, alone, manage the files here and are not hosted on a platform such as Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, or one of the numerous companies which make profit from their user's information.

Hopefully, this becomes a suit of armor and a source of strength: something to point at which I got to create completely under my own power. This mess of an entity is not meant to be read in one sitting. Reading more than one page should not be necessary because of the intent of this project: each file should be a singular and self-contained document which hold all the necessary information on whatever topic. Though one can always point at something to reference but unless you made it, one day when you reach for it, it will be gone.

## Built with [Gitbook](https://docs.gitbook.com/)

A web based interfaced that can works off on top of a network of plain text `.markdown`  files. This has the benefits of version control and easy integration with other programs such as Typora and Obsidian. However, cloning the entirety of the repo will also clone documents which belong in other books.  

## Working with a brainless mass

To maintain, and get a feel for where things are clone the [repository](https://github.com/nkintc/nkintc.github.io) and list the contents using:

```text
$ tree -L [n]
```

where `[n]` is the depth we are willing to traverse through this mess. However! Since this is a work in progress, cloning directly from the repository 

### Making your own

The first step is the hardest: saving a file. But once it is there and you treat it as a connection to all of the other files you manage, then in the process of tracking things down, this knowledge will grow over time. The hard part is ironing out all of the kinks.
