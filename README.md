  Welcome to a little digital garden and blog, where I keep a copy of my
  thoughts and notes on everything I know about the world. If it's worth
  learning, it's worth knowing.

# Welcome

This is one of two GitBooks where I note my knowledge in a digital form. Of the two this one is more narrative base and less factual,  per se.  rather than take  notes precisely, which is what [the sister GitBook](https://nkintc.gitbook.io/brainless) is for, this self-titled collection is more constructive and referential of the _brainless_ information contained in the other. Projects ideas and thoughts live here, whereas news, notes, and \(most\) links external sites belong in the other.
