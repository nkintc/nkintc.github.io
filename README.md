  Welcome to a little digital garden and blog, where I keep a copy of my
  thoughts and notes on everything I know about the world. If it's worth
  learning, it's worth knowing.

# Introduction

This is one of two GitBooks where I note my knowledge in a digital form. Of the two this one is more narrative base and less factual,  per se.  rather than take  notes precisely, which is what [the sister GitBook](https://nkintc.gitbook.io/brainless) is for, this self-titled collection is more constructive and referential of the brainless data contained in the other. Projects ideas and thoughts should live here, whereas news, notes, external sites belong in the other.
