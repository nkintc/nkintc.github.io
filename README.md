# What is this?

{% hint style="danger" %}
WIP - WYSIWYG

Why put a sample of my knowledge on the internet? Well this information has helped me so, with a little luck, someone in need of this might find it too. This site is [one of many](meta/sharing/inspirations.md) _digital gardens_. Though the naming is not perfect, I prefer this name because it promotes the idea of cultivation. The term _gardening_ breaks free from the more mundane part of writing. Tending to this garden is nonlinear and stochastic: doubling effort doesn't mean double the content, nor will doing the same thing twice will give the same results. Additionally, the process of growth is not beautiful and typically ugly for the duration. This helps me make peace with the difference between what I envision this garden to be in my mind and how it is on the screen. &#x20;
