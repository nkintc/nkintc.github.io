# What is this?

## Built with [Gitbook](https://docs.gitbook.com/)

A web based interfaced that can works off on top of a network of plain text `.markdown`  files. This has the benefits of version control and easy integration with other programs such as Typora and Obsidian.  

## Working with a brainless mass

To maintain, and get a feel for where things are clone the [repository](https://github.com/nkintc/nkintc.github.io) and list the contents using:

```text
$ tree -L [n]
```

where `[n]` is the depth we are willing to traverse through this mess. 

### Making your own

The first step is the hardest: saving a file. But once it is there and you treat it as a connection to all of the other files you manage, then in the process of tracking things down, this knowledge will grow over time.
