## Organization

This collection of markdown and other documents constitute a representative collection of my knowledge, since what is the point of doing something if you aren't willing to put your name to it? There  are obviously advantages to remaining anonymous but to make a real impact, there needs to be accountability. 

One of the names for this kind of collection of documents is a digital garden. Though the analogy is not perfect, it does promote the idea of cultivation. This process of writing is nonlinear and doing the same thing twice will give two different results: inspiration is a nonrenewable resource. Additionally, the process of growth is not beautiful. The steps in between stages is almost always gross 

First step, was simply writing and throwing words at the metaphysical page. But before being worth reading, some pruning needs to be done and some organization needs to come across before being ready for the public. Now, the process for developing brainless is adding content to a single \(set\) of pages to polish what work is already there. These are collected as pages under the [`[unreleased]`](https://nkintc.gitbook.io/brainless/unreleased) heading. The following are descriptions of the top level headings, seen in the sidebar. 

### Meta

These pages relate to my thoughts and reasoning on why this is a public wKKork. A newcomer should begin with the essay on [responsiblity](https://nkintc.gitbook.io/brainless/meta/responsibility) online. My \(human\) geography is my own personal history, if you want to get to know the author. Sharing is a set of pages which links to other digital gardens or second brains. Research are the list of projects which I have worked on. 

### Ideas

One of the main reasons for creating a work of art is to be though t provoking. As a person online in 2020, keeping track of these persistent works is difficult but worthwhile. Computer games, books, and film are all human creations: they serve no utility other than to make people _feel_ something. In grade school, teachers feed students the little lies so that they will be ready for the big ones. 

A little lie which students hear is that during English class, that they are searching for hidden meanings. I disagree fully: what students are actually doing \(and what the teachers use the lie for\) is to better the quality of though on the work. Give it time and enough thought, some meaning should bear fruit.  

### Mollusk

A little in-joke, as an individual moving from shell to shell. These pages collect computer notes and how the day to day works on.  

### Engineering Mathematics

These pages are based on class notes, but as I develop them further, the baseline organization of `syllabus` -&gt; `lecture notes` -&gt; `student notes` -&gt; `assignments` will begin to break down into a more organic arrangements, dependent on their topic. 

## Description of Brainless

This collection of markdown and other documents constitute a representative collection of my knowledge, since what is the point of doing something if you aren't willing to put your name to it? There  are obviously advantages to remaining anonymous but to make a real impact, there needs to be accountability. 

Internally, these Gitbooks are half-blog, half-journal, and perhaps half-something-else. Externally, these books serve as a lasting resource which documents the learning process for a variety of engineering courses as well documenting the processes for working on whatever projects are at hand. Additionally, it serves as a method of reclaiming social media as I, alone, manage the files here and are not hosted on a platform such as Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, or one of the numerous companies which make profit their from their user's information. There is an implicit expectation of regularity in posts which is not present here: I'm going to be working at my speed.

### Why bother putting these up?

> “Never forget what you are, for surely the world will not. Make it your strength. Then it can never be your weakness. Armour yourself in it, and it will never be used to hurt you.” - G. R. R. Martin

Hopefully, this becomes that suit of armor, indeed, a source of strength. Something to point at, which I created completely under my own power. During the creation of this, I can confess that it feels like being a shitty Soundcloud rapper, but on Github. 

But, this mess of an entity is not meant to be read in one sitting. Finishing one page should not necessarily lead on to the next; reading more than one page should not be necessary because each file should be a self-contained document.

Each page should hold all the necessary information on whatever topic: not explicitly but should at least point at where to turn to for more. Though one can always point at something to reference but unless you made something with it outside of your brain, one day when you reach for it, it will be gone. 

### Built with [Gitbook](https://docs.gitbook.com/)

A web based interfaced that can works off on top of a network of plain text `.markdown`  files. This has the benefits of version control and easy integration with other programs such as Typora and Obsidian. There are other benefits: hyperlinking, image and file hosting with built in commenting, math fonts through LaTeX, the list goes on. However, cloning the entirety of the repo will also clone documents which belong in other books and is a problem for another time. 

### Navigation 

If I had a set of three words which I try to live by, something which I have thought on for some time now, they would be `curiosity`,`integrity`, and `compassion`. Something about those three words, together, ring true to me. Particularly so, if treated as an ordered list. First, being `curiosity` as without the desire to know, there there is no impetus for the rest. If one doesn't know about the topic then what integrity is there to uphold or what is there compassion to be shown for? There needs to be that innate desire to know which will serve as the foundation for everything else. Then comes `integrity`, which is the property which allows for something to withstand the test of time. Finally `compassion`, which is more of a colligative property. It is something you can have for yourself but is most clearly seen when shared between two people. 

This brainless mass is most like the `curiosity` that I try to live by. For this to do some work, I've got to make some record. It might be at least two years late in writing this down, but in my defense I did not know that these resources existed and even if I did, I would not yet have 

### Making your own

The first step is the hardest: saving a file. I personally am one of the passive procrastinators and am trying to be an active one, so having an unfinished work which is open to the public is... not what I would consider ideal. But once it is there and you treat it as a connection to all of the other files you manage, then in the process of tracking things down, this knowledge will grow over time. The real problem is ironing out all of the kinks from a living document. And though this document is dedicated to the sciences and engineering, I think back to the quintessential polymath...
