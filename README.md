  Brainless is a personal description of the following collection of pages;
  without a purpose, it feels `brainless`. Meant to be a source for self
  reference, open to the public. WYSIWYG.

# What is this?

Everyone has a story; no one will tell it but you. 

This collection of markdown and other documents constitute a representative collection of my knowledge, since what is the point of doing something if you aren't willing to put your name to it? Internally, this is half blog, half journal, half something else...Externally, this serves as a lasting resource which documents the learning process for a variety of engineering courses as well as my personal process for working on whatever project is at hand. Additionally, it serves as a method of reclaiming social media as I, alone, manage the files here and are not hosted on a platform such as Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, or one of the numerous companies which make profit their from their user's information.

Hopefully, this becomes a suit of armor and a source of strength: something to point at which I got to create completely under my own power. This mess of an entity is not meant to be read in one sitting. Reading more than one page should not be necessary because of the intent of this project: each file should be a singular and self-contained document which hold all the necessary information on whatever topic. Though one can always point at something to reference but unless you made something with it outside of your brain, one day when you reach for it, it will be gone.

## Built with [Gitbook](https://docs.gitbook.com/)

A web based interfaced that can works off on top of a network of plain text `.markdown`  files. This has the benefits of version control and easy integration with other programs such as Typora and Obsidian. There are other benefits: hyperlinking, image and file hosting with built in commenting, math fonts through LaTeX, the list goes on. However, cloning the entirety of the repo will also clone documents which belong in other books and is a problem for another time. 

## Working with a brainless mass

To maintain, and get a feel for where things are clone the [repository](https://github.com/nkintc/nkintc.github.io) and list the contents using:

```text
$ tree -L [n]
```

where `[n]` is the depth we are willing to traverse through this mess. However! Since this is a work in progress, cloning directly from the repository will also clone the other gitbooks that I'm working: this means that folder structure is not preserved and working offline requires downloading the whole thing as well as all the other shit I'm working on in these gitbooks.  

### Navigation 

If I had a set of three words which I try to live by, something which I have thought on for some time now, they would be `curiosity`,`integrity`, and `compassion`. Something about those three words, together, ring true to me. Particularly so, if treated as an ordered list. First, being `curiosity` as without the desire to know, there there is no impetus for the rest. If one doesn't know about the topic then what integrity is there to uphold or what is there compassion to be shown for? There needs to be that innate desire to know which will serve as the foundation for everything else. Then comes `integrity`, which is the property which allows for something to withstand the test of time. Finally `compassion`, which is more of a colligative property. It is something you can have for yourself but is most clearly seen when shared between two people. 

This brainless mass is most like the `curiosity` that I try to live by. For this to do some work, I've got to make some record. It might be at least two years late in writing this down, but in my defense I did not know that these resources existed and even if I did, I would not yet have 

### Making your own

The first step is the hardest: saving a file. I personally am one of the passive procrastinators and am trying to be an active one, so having an unfinished work which is open to the public is... not what I would consider ideal. But once it is there and you treat it as a connection to all of the other files you manage, then in the process of tracking things down, this knowledge will grow over time. The real problem is ironing out all of the kinks from a living document. And though this document is dedicated to the sciences and engineering, I think back to the quintessential polymath...
