More often than not, the governing equation for some system is related to some proportionality between two quantities. Newton's second law, the equation for energy, the equation for electrical power, electro magnetic field voltage potentials, generalized Hooke's Law:

$$
{\bf F} = m{\bf a} ,E = {\bf F}\cdot {\bf d},  P = IV; V = IR; \mathbf{C} \mathbf{d}=\mathbf{e}
$$

What these equations share is that they are all linear algebra. The notation is specific and the context in which they are discussed are important but they all are functionally the same: a single conserved quantity is the product of two which vary. As one gets larger the other must get smaller for the overall quantity to be conserved. Rewritten using index notation, the relationship between the dimensions of the tensors becomes much more clear. Omitting the scalar equations,  the vector equations seem much less abstract:

$$
F_i = ma_i ; E = F_j d_j ; C_{ijkl} d_{kl} = e_{ij}.
$$
