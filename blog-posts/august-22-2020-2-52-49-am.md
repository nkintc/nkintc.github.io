Math is so weird, you can ask questions like how many [straight lines it takes to cover all 50 states](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/181855/what-if-xkcd-com-stabbing-simply-connected-regions-on-the-2-sphere-with-few-g/374512#374512?newreg=541a230278b24bc4b51ba57cde81918e). On that note, I also want to travel to [Gibbs Farms](https://www.gibbsfarm.org.nz/), to see cartoonishly drawn sculptures.
