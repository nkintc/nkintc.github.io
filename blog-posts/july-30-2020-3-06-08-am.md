People don't just die.

It generally is a process which occurs over the course of hours to days; sudden death gets its distinction because it is unusual and because of its severity, a singular cause of death can be established. These are the two extremes: the long and drawn-out process of dying versus  an instantaneous event.

All deaths then lie somewhere along this continuum which we can treat as a unit interval. The complexity comes from trying to establish where along the number line between 0 and 1 does each death lay? The practical implication is when someone is in the hospital how long  does the doctor allow for the patient to code for,  before calling said code?

Clearly, the younger the patient is the longer that code should go for because youth has an inherent survivability which old age does not; we expect older people to die because they have had a longer life and therefore have had to endure the burden of living for longer.
