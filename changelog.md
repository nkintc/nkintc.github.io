Not much has changed except for moving much of the content over to brain was, essentially much removal. However,  a more streamlined approach towards organization was forum,  such that these pages are mainly random collections of thoughts and possible blog post ideas.

### Removed

* Quantum computing notes moved to brainless, slides from Microsoft downloaded and linked.
* Ender 3 moved to 3D Printing project page from brainless.

### Changed

* Ordinary skincare page collected with regular skincare page.
