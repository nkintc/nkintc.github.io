# macOS

### Alfred

Bless this program. One of the first that I paid money for and didn't regret. It serves mainly as a conduit between programs, more than anything 

### Sublime

Nice, lightweight, reliable. Full of plugins to make it into a more IDE like workspace.

### Typora

If there was any program that I had to say I liked most, would be this one. The simple markdown editor has so much utility. Making use of the `mermaid` integration allows for inline diagram rendering, a quality that I wish gitbook also had. The `mermaidjs` is a gitbook as well, and their work around is just a hard link. 

### VLC

Super reliable video player. Odd filetype? This is the Swiss army knife to shank it with. That might not be the right analogy but VLC can probably open it too. 

### Gmsh

From the handbook:

> Gmsh is a three-dimensional finite element mesh generator with a build-in CAD engine and post-processor. Its design goal is to provide a fast, light and user-friendly meshing tool with parametric input and advanced visualization capabilities.

Documentation is found [here](https://gitlab.onelab.info/gmsh/gmsh/-/wikis/home). 

### OpenSCAD

A parametric solid modeler. Where Gmsh is meant to interact with parts, OpenSCAD is meant for design and part creation. Relatively WYSIWYG, its another open-source project designed for simplicity. Found through Jacob. 

### Cura 

Where to go to turn those `.stl` and `.obj` files into `.gcode` to be printed. The 3D printer I have as of 2020 is my first one, a Creality Ender 3 Pro, with a build volume of `220 x 220 x 250mm`. 

### Ovito

Program to visualize those `.dump` files output. Makes pretty photos, and can visualize timeseries data. Did a \(grueling\) project with Emily on CNTs. 

### VMD

Just as powerful as Ovito IMO. Turned onto it through research, has a built in plugin to design different CNT's depending on chiral numbers and length.



## Command Line Programs 

`nnn`... A go-to file tree navigator. Lightweight, low-config, `hjkl` navigation style

`fuck` ... is the alias, `brew install thefuck` is the command to run on install. Helps take care of fat-fingering a command

`taskwarrior` ... the CLI to do list manager. 

`timewarrior`... sister program to taskwarrior
