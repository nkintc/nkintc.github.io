# Programs

### 

### 

### Chrome 

Ubiquitous, this and vimium makes traversing the internet a breeze. That might be a little too far, but at least less of a chore. 

### Backup-and-Sync

Keep documents up to date without having to worry about. Doesn't have version control but `drive.google.com` does keep a record. Plays well with `git`. 

### Signal

Preferable over texting but hey, everything has a place. 

### cmake

Play with `.cpp` gotta have `cmake` .
