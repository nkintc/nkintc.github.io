# Experimental Mechanics

One of the three graduate level courses I took the first semester of school at RPI. If there was a message that I could give myself prior class registration is to have taken only one or at most two 6000 level courses and drop either [Solid Mechanics](https://nkintc.gitbook.io/brainless/engr-math/fluid-mechanics/solid-mechanics) or Tribology because the combination of all three, in addition to beginning to conduct research and the responsibilities of being a teaching assistant in for Physics lab was just too much for my first semester. 

But this course just had so much practical knowledge and was taught by a wonderful professor that I have no regrets learning these concepts.
