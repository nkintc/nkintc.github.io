# Continuum Mechanics

Collection of 3 courses: Fluid Mechanics, Solid Mechanics, and Incompressible Flow which all have their own take on continuum mechanics. Once again, I go back to the etymology of the phrase: continuum being some smooth contiguous thing and mechanics being the study of forces. 



Material Derivative



$$
\frac{D}{Dt} 
=
\frac{\partial}{\partial t} 
+
{\bf v}\cdot{\nabla}
$$
