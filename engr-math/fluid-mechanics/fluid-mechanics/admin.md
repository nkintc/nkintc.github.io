### Summary from the [Course Catalog Description ](http://catalog.rpi.edu/preview_course.php?catoid=18&coid=34421&print)

> An introductory graduate course in fluid mechanics. Topics include: continuum hypothesis; perfect gas and departures from perfect gas; vectors and tensors; conservation laws for a continuum: mass momentum and energy; constitutive theory for fluids; viscosity and molecular transport; compressible Navier-Stokes equations; kinematics of the flow field: vorticity, streamlines; incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and their applications: Poiseuille flow, low Reynolds number flows, flows at large Reynolds number, boundary layers, external flows: flow stability and introduction to the theory of turbulence
