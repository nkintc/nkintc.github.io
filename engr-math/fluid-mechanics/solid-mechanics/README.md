# Solid Mechanics

### Dear god the single hardest class that I've ever taken

> This course provides an introduction to the mechanics of solids from a continuum perspective. Topics covered in this course include: vector and tensor analysis, coordinate systems and calculus in curvilinear coordinate systems, kinematics \(motion, deformation and strain\), stress and momentum balance, energy principles and balance laws, linear isotropic and anisotropic elasticity, thermoelasticity, method of solutions for 2-D and 3-D linear elastic boundary value problems, applications to simple structures.

This is the ceiling on the complexity of information that I can reasonably understand...

### Force 

Mechanical interaction \(push or pull\) between 

* parts of a body
* body and environment 

Contact Force 

Act on a surface due to contact  with environment or other parts of the body

Body Force 

Exerted through the interior of a body, due to environment or itself 

* gravity 
* electromagnetism
* self gravitation 

Traction 

Stress vector. the second definition is due to newton's second law 

$$
{\bf T}({\bf n},{\bf y}, t) = \lim\limits_{dA \rightarrow 0} \frac{d{\bf {p}}}{dA} = -{\bf T}(-{\bf n},{\bf y}, t)
$$

Momentum Balance Laws Newton Euler Equations 

Balance of Linear Momentum 

$$
{\bf P}(V,t) = \frac{d}{dt} \left[{\bf \ell}(V,t)\right] ; \quad {\bf \ell}(V,t)= \int\limits_V {\bf v}({\bf y},t)\rho({\bf y},t)dV
$$

$$
{\bf M}(V,t,{\bf p}) = \frac{d}{dt} \left[{\bf h}(V,t,{\bf p})\right] ; \quad {\bf h}(V,t,{\bf p})= \int\limits_V \left({\bf y}-{\bf p}\right)\times{\bf v}({\bf y},t)\rho({\bf y},t)dV
$$
