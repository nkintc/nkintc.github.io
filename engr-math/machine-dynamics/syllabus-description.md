# Syllabus Description

This course is my least favorite course which I have taken because it required the most self-instruction. It felt like a partial relearning of concepts which I thought I already understood because the lectures were not as helpful as usual. The closest representation already online is [sympy](https://docs.sympy.org/latest/modules/physics/mechanics/index.html) and the classical mechanics module.
