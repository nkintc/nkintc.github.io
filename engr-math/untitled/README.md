Notes from [eigenChris's ](https://www.youtube.com/user/eigenchris)video series, which is surprisingly apt. I'm a little staggered at the size of his library of work but 

$$
A \cos (\omega t+\alpha)+B \cos (\omega t+\beta) \\
= \sqrt{[A \cos (\alpha)+B \cos (\beta)]^{2}+[A \sin (\alpha)+B \sin (\beta)]^{2}} 
\\
\cos \left\{\omega t+\tan ^{-1}\left[\frac{A \sin (\alpha)+B \sin (\beta)}{A \cos (\alpha)+B \cos (\beta)}\right]\right\}
$$

Multivariate calculus is the extension of of univariate calculus, which studies mappings $$f: \mathcal{R} \rightarrow \mathcal{R}$$ to more generic $$\boldsymbol{g}: \mathcal{R}^{n} \rightarrow \mathcal{R}^{m}$$; relating a vector, $$\boldsymbol{x}$$ of some length$$n$$ to some other vector $$\boldsymbol{y}$$of length $$m$$by multiplication with some some rectangular matrix of dimensions,  $$m \times n$$. This framework is used in all courses except for Machine Dynamics because that class said fuck you that's why.

Fluid Mechanics content is fully on brainless but is desperately in need of revision and sorting.
