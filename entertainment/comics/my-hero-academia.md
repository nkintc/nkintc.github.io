# My Hero Academia

## Getting Super Powers

Becoming a super hero is a fairly straight forward process:

```
$ mkdir one-for-all && all-for-one -r add * 
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
 Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

{% code title="all-might-transfer" %}
```bash
# Eat this! - All Might
echo 'Whaaaaa? - Izuku Midoriya'
```
{% endcode %}
