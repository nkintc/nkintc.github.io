# Cowboy Bebop

On the ambiguity of the ending and the[ context of Spike](http://bebopattic.weebly.com/between-the-lines.html)'s final fight with Vicious. 

### Musical Sessions

Just as how the impetus of this `brainless` endeavor was the 2020 Coronavirus pandemic and the social isolation which followed, my renewed focus on Cowboy Bebop is similarly driven by how the original musical cast of the show recently got back together for a [special rendition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GwE0wwMmKE) of [The Real Folk Blues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyI635o2pmk), as well as a more mellow [Lo-Fi version ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dX8gZubnMjA)which I quite enjoy.
