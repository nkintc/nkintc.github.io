# Laundry

Not gonna lie. I suck at laundry. There is a perpetual corner of my closet that has unassorted and unfolded laundry getting wrinkly at this moment, most likely. However, I do try to keep everything visible in a Marie Kondo-like way. 

In her videos, she will try to fold clothing in such a way that it stands up on its own. However, this isn't always possible as it depends on the fabric. But the attempt is certainly admirable. 

Process seems to be bisect or lay pair one atop the other, so the fabric is a long strip.
