# Laundry

Not gonna lie. I suck at laundry. There is a perpetual corner of my closet that has unassorted and unfolded laundry getting wrinkly at this moment, most likely. However, I do try to keep everything visible in a Marie Kondo-like way. 

In her videos, she will try to fold clothing in such a way that it stands up on its own. However, this isn't always possible as it depends on the fabric. But the attempt is certainly admirable. 

Process seems to be bisect the symmetric clothing article, or lay one of the pair atop the other, so the fabric is a long strip.

   * topsheet ... give extra at top
   * faux fur comforter protector

3. roll together off to preserve layering
4. stack head and pillows in corner 
5. fold over
