summary from [here](https://smmry.com/2860086403#&SM_LENGTH=7)

> As always, every patient is different! Acne: first presentations, for most patients she prescribed as follows: Doxycycline for 2 months topicals So many new patient consults going on Doxy and followups for Doxy.
>
> Would instruct patients to start every other night, and see how they tolerated it.
>
> Advised patients with dryness to either moisturize before, or mix with moisturizer.
>
> For moisturizer, she recommended vanicream to almost every patient.
>
> Sulfacleans/ prescription sulfa based cleanser once a day prescription benzoyl peroxide based cleanser,, sometimes patients were on the sulfa in the morning, benzoyl peroxide cleanser at night.
>
> There are a lot of concerning side effects that go along with accutane, but no patients presented with any in the time I was there and labs were always A-OK and patients proceeded.
>
> Most patients were recommended 4-6 treatments and the cheapest I saw was $3,000.

overall this is

> I love this sub, and just finished a dermatology rotation where I heard the same instructions repeated every day for 4 weeks. I am not a physician and I am not giving medical advice- I am only repeating the regimens this specific dermatologist recommended to her patients in case anyone is curious. A lot of dermatologists have their staples they stick with and it's obvious what hers were, you might see another derm and get completely different recommendations. And as always, every patient is different!
>
> **Acne**: first presentations, for most patients she prescribed as follows:
>
> * Doxycycline for 2 months + topicals So many new patient consults going on Doxy and followups for Doxy. A lot of 2 month follow ups were saying it worked, the ones that didn't she gave the option of accutane or to try another month or 2. Warned a lot about upset stomach and said take it after a substantial meal, at least 30mins-an hour before going to bed/laying down to prevent upset stomach and heartburn.
>
> Topicals she would prescribe with or without Doxy:
>
> * Differin \(OTC\), instructed patients to disperse a pea sized amount on the finger, dot on the forehead/cheeks etc and then spread evenly. Would instruct patients to start every other night, and see how they tolerated it. Move to nightly based on that, skip a day in between if skin was red and flaky. Advised patients with dryness to either moisturize before, or mix with moisturizer.
> * For moisturizer, she recommended vanicream to almost every patient.
> * Sulfacleans/ prescription sulfa based cleanser once a day \(usually instructed in the morning\)
> * prescription benzoyl peroxide based cleanser, \(usually instructed for PM use\), sometimes patients were on the sulfa in the morning, benzoyl peroxide cleanser at night. Strong emphasis on moisturizer and SPF with these and starting with one at a time.
> * She recommended Elta MD sunscreen a lot. But always suggested using at least SPF 50 on the face because "it's really like an SPF 30" due to absorption
> * She prescribed AcZone a handful of times, never saw any followups for results.
>
> **Acne resistant to these regimens**: offered accutane/isotretinoin. Talked about the ipledge program, required birth control for women, requires initial labs with re-checks at 1-2 months. Said 6 months to work. Most common side effect was dryness. Recommended vanicream for moisturizer and vaseline for lip moisture. Hats, SPF 50, and UV protective clothing. She was really big on SPF hats and clothing from a brand called coolibar. There are a lot of concerning side effects that go along with accutane, but no patients presented with any in the time I was there and labs were always A-OK and patients proceeded.
>
> **Hormonal acne**: she would prescribe spironolactone, but required a form of birth control due to potential birth defects for male babies. She didn't prescribe OCP's but recommended women see an OBGYN if they wanted it and she would check labs as well. Most common callback was for lightheadedness/ frequent urination, always recommended to drink a lot of water.
>
> **Dandruff**: this was a common one and she recommended buying and rotating multiple anti-dandruff shampoos: T-gel, selsyn blue, head and shoulders. If they came in the office she would give them a fourth prescription strength one.
>
> **Acne scars**: Always said to clear the acne first, and then address the scars. She was a laser provider so she would go straight to laser treatment- which is expensive but holy crap it works. Most patients were recommended 4-6 treatments and the cheapest I saw was $3,000. They numb you, but it is still painful as hell. But some follow-ups had improvement after even one treatment.
