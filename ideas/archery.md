# Archery



Given the prevalence of archery in  movies, books, and other media, every protagonist who picks up a bow and fires an arrow seems to be a natural crack shot, every time. That seems to rub off on all of their viewers in a sense of confidence that every arrow will find its way to the bullseye. However, upon reaching the firing line  for the first time and letting loose an arrow that illusion is quickly broken. 

Archery is hard. Surmounting that challenge requires continuous practice.

My preference in compound target archery comes from a desire to make the best shot possible without having to worry about the strain of holding while aiming.  my preference of target vs hunting is that I don't have a desire to change my target but rather try and pursue that ideal release rather than pursue an animal. However, 3D target shooting go I've never attempted it does seem something like I would enjoy.

It's an incredibly meditative activity because of the necessity of consistency. Repetitive practice in perfect form to make perfect shots. What was the most important things I've learned is reaching a large volume of arrows for each practice session.  Firing as much as possible and in time learning what you feel allows for the most consistent release.  

Of the hobbies and skills to cultivate, this is one of the few that is a solely one person activity. Additionally, it is one of the sports where men and women can compete against each other or on the same team. Men and women are not segregated by gender which is a refreshing change of pace in competitive. 

### Setting Up



### Gap Shooting 

Beginning with basic barebow, or sightless, archery one of the first skills taught is gap shooting or a rudimentary method of aiming.
