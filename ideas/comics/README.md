# Comics and Games

Playing games feels like a important aspect of The Human Experience: in an enclosed space  one or more people  I placed in an environment where rules have been made such that  there is a definite sensation of Victory or loss.  this includes single player and multiplayer modes.  each bringing a separate sense of satisfaction.

The example game for single player for me is Sekiro: a pared-down rhythm game disguised as a hack and slash.  the most important rule for your characters after every attack there is an instance where your character is vulnerable. Just like in smash bros, there are no hit guaranteed combos: but you have to hunt after your opponent to make sure every attack lands.

As for noncooperative multiplayer games in a battle arena such as League of Legends or Super Smash Bros, it is an inherently closed system: what one character gains is an opportunity loss from the opposing side doesn't matter if there is only one opponent, like in chess; or many other enemies on a single side, like League; or a host of enemies in a free for all, like PUBG. 

The sensation of mastering a character or game is one unlike any other:  it can only  be experienced by someone who has achieved the same goals and can only be meaningfully referenced between those who have an understanding of the work which is required to accomplish that task. Example and smash is my personal favorite character Ike.  the following phrase would make no sense unless the listener has a background in the terminology for Smash characters

> quick draw --&gt; reverse jump cancel --&gt; grab --&gt; backthrow --&gt; jump --&gt; dair off stage spike

A possible finishing pseudo combo Ike can perform on Mid to heavyweight characters in the mid-range percentile. Sudo because none of these attacks are guaranteed to land like they are in Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat. But you must control the characters such  that both it and the opponent are in a position such that the attack will land.
