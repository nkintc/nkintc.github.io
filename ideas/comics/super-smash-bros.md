  This series is a work of art. In many ways its a hall of fame: every single
  player character comes from another noteworthy franchise. If they're fighting,
  they're going to be remembered.

# Super Smash Bros

Smash as a game is so straightforward but so complex that it embodies the quick to pick up but hard to master niche. It's not just a party game but also a [beautiful thing to spectate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qxVDOc-oV8). The version that I enjoy most is Project M: a user community mod of Brawl. Brawl itself is not a bad game... per say... but it much more simplistic than the speed that Melee had gotten the player base hyped about.
