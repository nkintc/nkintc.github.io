# Carbon Nanotubes

Main design equation for the diameter of the CNT, dependent on the chiral numbers `(n,m)`.  

$$
d_{t}=\frac{C_{h}}{\pi}=\frac{\sqrt{3} a_{c-c}}{\pi} \sqrt{n^{2}+n m+m^{2}}
$$

Would go back to [this site](http://www.photon.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~maruyama/kataura/chirality.html) as reference. `a_{c-c}` is the length of the Carbon-Carbon bond, 1.421 Ã….
