# Death

This is a hard page to write. Thoughts become so convoluted at the thought of an infinity of endless nothing. But I will try and talk about it. Try and fail and try again until something meaningful comes about.&#x20;

The first time that death touched my life was when my mom passed from cancer. I should have seen it coming but I thought that there was no way that she could die. Writing it down now, how naive I was to think that she was invincible and immortal; she was only human. But that's what she was to me, immortal and invincible. &#x20;

"She will get through it", I thought. "Things will go back to normal", I told myself. "We have decades together still", I convinced myself each day. Even as the cancer ate away at her, those thoughts were constant. Life would become constant again and my family would remain whole.

Until it broke.&#x20;

Until I got the phone call that she was gone and that I was not there when she passed.&#x20;
