As for the philosophy lets look at the etymology of the world 

> philosophy
>
> The noun philosophy means the study of proper behavior, and the search for wisdom.
>
> The original meaning of the word philosophy comes from the Greek roots philo- meaning "love" and -sophos, or "wisdom." When someone studies philosophy they want to understand how and why people do certain things and how to live a good life. In other words, they want to know the meaning of life. Add the suffix -er to philosophy, and you get a word for someone whose job it is to think these big thoughts.
