[James Vaughan](https://jamesbvaughan.com/markdown-pandoc-notes/) is the first person that I read who got the idea in my head for the need to take notes without having to move over to the mouse. As I think more about it, a mouse is a far more rudimentary method interacting with data: it is better optimized for the sharing of information as a second person takes [direct control](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3h8ZnXLsRg).
