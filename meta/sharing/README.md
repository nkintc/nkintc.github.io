# Sharing

The internet was built originally to share information. On 12 March 1989, Tim Berners Lee proposed and later implemented the [Hypertext Transfer Protocol](https://www.w3.org/Talks/9608HTTP/) and since its framework was developed, the Internet has grown to a degree that no one in its early days could have imagined.

This gitbook here is my little corner of it. Below are other sites where you can find me.&#x20;

* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nkintc): Musings are my own, and some views on current events
* [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/nkintc/): Watch me do stuff and look at my face! Might see something fun
* [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-nkinthorn-65463213a/): The less fun version of stuff but a little more polished.&#x20;

One would hope that records of their actions is leaves lasting impacts and meaningful results; that they are useful not just to one's own self but also the likeminded and perhaps even to strangers. An unfortunate consequence of the has been a depersonalization in the interactions between people.&#x20;

On a tangential note, there's a term in construction called a tofu project. Typically used in China in instances where buildings collapse because of subpar construction methods. Fundamentally, the problem lies in trying to pass off a work as more than it actually is. Tofu projects are a form of deception, trying to certify work less sturdy than they are passing it off for.&#x20;

This problem isn't seen in open source software; one could say that open source software lets you see how it is built but I would argue that that phrasing would distance A singular object as to different things: a difference without a distinction. open source software does not just let you see how it is built: it \*is\* the thing which is being used.&#x20;

* Open-source software combats the problem of misrepresentation&#x20;
  * Misrepresentation is combated by eliminating a "middle man"&#x20;
* Showing work combats the problem of misinterpretation&#x20;
  * Seeing the original work allows for direct understanding&#x20;

On Github, opening up some repository on the web allows for an opensource version control: letting users see not just the code, but issues, pull requests, actions, and insights into how it is developed by users. There should be no tofu projects on Github. There are notes and gists and README’s which don’t make sense, certainly, but they are not being passed off as more than they are. They are just that: notes, gists, and README’s. Don't read into it any deeper than needed because more than likely there is no intended meaning there.&#x20;
