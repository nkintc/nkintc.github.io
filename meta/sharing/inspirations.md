  might be the best description for this collection, but those listed below has
  more than just what I'm attempting.

### Exobrains and the[ Extended Mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_mind_thesis)

This is also called a [digital garden](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden). I quite like this idea as it grows over time, the author merely tending to the collection until it bears fruit. The oldest collection of thought, and the first which I stumbled upon, was [Mathpages](https://www.mathpages.com/)'s approach to solving for the effective resistance between two nodes in an [infinite grid of resistors](https://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath668/kmath668.htm).

[Life logging is an extended diary ](https://beepb00p.xyz/tags.html#lifelogging)and [what to choose](https://beepb00p.xyz/my-data.html#dashboard) is important. A little story which comes to mind is a comment Dr. Mills made during Experimental Mechanics about how many data points to take during an extensometer reading: rather than analyzing the entire video file simply use a select representative frames as using the whole video would, indeed, be excessive. One would think that this brainless mess would be excessive and disproportionate, but the idea of proportionality falls apart in the face of infinity.
