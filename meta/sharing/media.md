# Social Media

The internet is just a bunch of computers.&#x20;

What a stunning revelation, I know. But there is a point: at the end of the day, how people communicate is through some medium. Both transmissions and recption of information are susceptible to error. Under layers and layers of GUI's and popup windows and buttons that's what social media is. Going back to the etymology of the phrase, communication between two individuals is a _social_  interaction and the intermediate which is used is the _media_ in which the interaction occurred.&#x20;

Every Facebook post, every Instagram photo, every single one of Twitter's ever growing number of user tweets is a fragment of social media. On the off-chance that this is read and found useful, one would hope that the fragments of the interactions reflect kindly on the memory of who they were.&#x20;
