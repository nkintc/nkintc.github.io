# Workflows

## Knowledge Wiki

Writing most online work in markdown files, nowadays. Using Gitbook pages to maintain revision control across machines. [Obsidian ](https://obsidian.md/features)and [Typora](https://typora.io/) are my main workspaces, per-say. Both follow FOSS, or at least the free part. They are both available on macOS, Windows, and Linux. Most of the initial work goes into has gone into throwing as much _content_ and letting pairings and organization develop naturally: what do I want to keep track of and let the order come later.

## Day-to-Day Notes

As much time as I spend on the computer, I generally prefer to write out ideas or thoughts. There are too many reasons as to explain why, but one key aspect is being able to freely draw as many lines as one pleases. Lines as letters, as objects, as graphs which can all live on the same sheet of paper. Unless the written notes are bound in a journal or notebook format or they are a contiguous set of notes which fill out more than a single page, I will typically not use the reverse side of the paper. Instead when full, photo scan and file into some directory. Additionally, cropped photos of a white board is also filed in their own folder.

As for the philosophy lets look at the etymology of the world 

> philosophy
>
> The noun philosophy means the study of proper behavior, and the search for wisdom.
>
> The original meaning of the word philosophy comes from the Greek roots philo- meaning "love" and -sophos, or "wisdom." When someone studies philosophy they want to understand how and why people do certain things and how to live a good life. In other words, they want to know the meaning of life. Add the suffix -er to philosophy, and you get a word for someone whose job it is to think these big thoughts.
