# Workflows

## Knowledge Wiki

Writing most online work in markdown files, nowadays. Using Gitbook pages to maintain revision control across machines. [Obsidian ](https://obsidian.md/features)and [Typora](https://typora.io/) are my main workspaces, per-say. Both follow FOSS, or at least the free part. They are both available on macOS, Windows, and Linux. Most of the initial work goes into has gone into throwing as much _content_ and letting pairings and organization develop naturally: what do I want to keep track of and let the order come later.

When writing articles on brainless, I'll try to get the words down first and fill in the links later. it would be really nice to have some time tracking on this but I'm only human and can only do so much at one time.  additionally seeing how long this takes as it chips away by the hour would probably eat very quickly at any drive to keep going.&#x20;



## Day-to-Day Notes

As much time as I spend on the computer, I generally prefer to write out ideas or thoughts. There are too many reasons as to explain why, but one key aspect is being able to freely draw as many lines as one pleases. Lines as letters, as objects, as graphs which can all live on the same sheet of paper. Unless the written notes are bound in a journal or notebook format or they are a contiguous set of notes which fill out more than a single page, I will typically not use the reverse side of the paper. Instead when full, photo scan and file into some directory. Additionally, cropped photos of a white board are also filed in their own folder.&#x20;
