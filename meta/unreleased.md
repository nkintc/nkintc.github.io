# \[unreleased]

One of my biggest regrets from college is not saving my work and notes: at the time it seemed reasonable but as the years have worn on my recollection of events has deteriorated into nothingness. only the barest essentials from the various classes remain and even then the details are hazy at best. this is a motivation for putting all of my notes online given the movement towards open source where and the free and readily available storage a consumption of knowledge.

Ideally these would have gone up when I was first introduced to this information for the best possible retention but this idea was not available to me at that point. Additionally the re consumption of this knowledge will help rebuild those knowledge bonds more firmly than before
