# Notes and Ideas

* Cold calling feels like the "Zuko here" meme
* My dad made me/us present gifts to the nurses and thank them for tending to mom. At the time I felt frustration but now it was the right thing.

Learning. A language is like Initially a hellish alien planet, then a dark jungle with glimpses of beauty, then a lush garden. Eventually that also becomes a desert because the language outlives is usefulness. But hey some last much longer than others

"You missed all of my vital organs" is so stupid

2023 01 11

My grandmother asked how long it has been since mom died. She doesn't know how low it has been since she buried her own daughter?

Though afterwards, she would say that she thought of Mom everyday. Who am I to think that her pain is any less than my own. Would she want to remember the date of her own daughter's death? I would not. Just to carry the weight of her memory is overwhelming already.&#x20;
