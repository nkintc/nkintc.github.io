# Respect

After we cremated my mom's body, my dad had me return to the hospital with gifts. We went to the nurses who took care of her and thanked them for taking care of her. We gave them gifts and clothing. We bowed low and told them thank you. At the time, I was frustrated and angry: why were we thanking them? They failed. My mom was dead and they didn't save her. Maybe I was just looking for someone to blame.

In retrospect, my dad was still teaching me. They made her last days better it was the right thing to do. In some regard, we are all in the service sector. We all should be helping others at the end of the day. Treating others with dignitiy&#x20;
