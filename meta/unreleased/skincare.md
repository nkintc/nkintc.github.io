# Skincare

If I was a rich bitch, I would be using [Sulwhasoo](https://us.sulwhasoo.com/) like my cousin but noooooo, I'm not willing to. Going to use Beauty of Joseon since it's cheaper and I still need to set up a meaningful routine.&#x20;

Really it's cleanser, toner, moisturizer, and sunscreen if it's the morning. It seems to be the same across [reddit ](https://old.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/wiki/new\_user\_guide/ab102)for r/skincare and r/asianbeauty.&#x20;
