# Stride

It's useful to get an estimation of lengths using the human body; you can't forget your body as you would a ruler. The simplest is converting your stride or pace to a distance. Here is mine using a treadmill for a known distance and the pedometer function from a smartwatch.

A: 1930 steps at 1.00 mi&#x20;

B: 2872 steps at 1.50 mi

Optionally, convert that 0.50 miles to meters.

942/804 \[step/meter] is \~1.17 \[step/meter]

The reciprocal is \~0.85 \[meter/step]
