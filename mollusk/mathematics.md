# Mathematics

Mathematics is such a broad term for what I want to cover. There are many that are broken out that should be covered under this but I digress.

Analytic hierarchy Process (AHP) is a method for decision making which compares the relative choices that one can make, weighs them, and then uses that to make the most informed decision. I stumbled upon during my time at LANL for EVMS and became interested in how this process works. First link that I found helpful was a [Stack Exchange page](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1272705/priority-vector-and-eigenvectors-ahp-method). &#x20;
