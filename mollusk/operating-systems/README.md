# Operating Systems

I spend way too much time on the computer that I should at least take some notes on the different kinds that I spend that time on. As of 2020 there are three major  computer operating systems \(OS’s\):  Windows, macOS, Linux.  Windows is the workhorse:  if you had to select the computer at random more than likely it's running some form of Windows.  Apple machines are running some version of a proprietary Macintosh computer system, which allow for people to have their own niche applications and fixing to make their computer an extension of themselves. My dad was always annoyed that I like to use these machines but ¯\\_\(ツ\)\_/¯. Finally, Linux comes in various distributions and is the computer scientist’s choice in OS and what my dad wished that I would use more often. But when you run into a problem then it’s all up to you to fix it and I am just too lazy for that.
