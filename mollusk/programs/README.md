# Programs

### Chrome 

Ubiquitous way of roaming the web. Moving away from it since the security leak, even if I'm deep into it. Facebook gets the same message. However that aside, this program and the vimium extension makes traversing the internet a breeze. That might be a bit of hyperbole, but it is at least less of a chore. 

[Burn.link](https://burn.link/) secure one time messaging.

### Backup-and-Sync

Keep documents up to date without having to worry about. Doesn't have version control but `drive.google.com` does keep a record. Plays well with `git`. 

### Signal

Preferable over texting but hey, everything has a place. 

### cmake

Play with `.cpp` gotta have `cmake` .

[Gitsheet](https://gitsheet.wtf/) cheat sheet

git bare repo 

A git controlled repo has two parts: a hidden `.git` folder which contains the files which the program `git` needs to function to recreate the workspace, which is the other user side component. using the function-command

```text
$ git clone --bare [fileName1] [fileName2]
```

this is a three state system because there are two clone processes

* original repository 
* bare repository
* git version controlled repo

really useful in creating a new project which is based in large part from another repo
