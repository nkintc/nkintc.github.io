# Audacity

Funnily enough, this was the first program needed in high school AP Physics, used to view waveforms. At the time it didn't really make sense, which may be a mixture of my ignorance and the way the information was presented. It made viewing pure sinusoids and their interactions as beats very clear.&#x20;

It is a nice program because it is both cross platform and opensource.
