# Google Chrome

This program is generally where I waste all of my time, some of which is spent productively writing and actively thinking about projects or problems. However, sites like Reddit, Imgur, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, etc, … are also available on the internet sooooo… ¯\\_\(ツ\)\_/¯

At this point Google has pretty much everything they need to replicate me however they wish.  But the point of consumer privacy is that no one has access to all the information at once.  additionally this is the information which I want to have public anyway:  ideally it should be useful to someone else as well. Being thoughtful as to what is public and what should be private is what makes the private information valuable. 

```text
chrome://omnibox/
```

Allows for managing the search bar

```text
data:text/html, <html contenteditable>
```

to create a scratchpad to work on.
