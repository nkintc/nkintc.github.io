# Google Chrome

At this point Google has pretty much everything they need to replicate me however they wish.  But the point of consumer privacy is that no one has access to all the information at once.  additionally this is the information which I want to have public anyway:  ideally it should be useful to someone else as well. Being thoughtful as to what is public and what should be private is what makes the private information valuable.

Here's how to get the transcript of a YouTube video \(when available\):

* Go to YouTube and open the video of your choice.
* Click on the "More actions" button \(3 horizontal dots\) located next to the Share button.
* Click "Open transcript"

Although the syntax may be a little goofy this is a pretty good solution.
