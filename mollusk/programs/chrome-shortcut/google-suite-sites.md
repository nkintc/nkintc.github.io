# Google Suite Sites

This company apparently has its fingers in everything: a site to [Keep](https://keep.google.com/) notes, a personal [Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/r/customday) to manage events, [mail](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/) managed with Gmail filters, and a file [Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/) which manages version control between devices. The cost being that this is all linked to a singular account, but not everything that Google makes is hooked to an account. 

Google's [Music Lab](https://musiclab.chromeexperiments.com/) is a chrome experiment which has a variety of instruments \(heh, instruments\) which measures and display those measurements in a meaningful way. Watching music through the [spectrogram](https://musiclab.chromeexperiments.com/Spectrogram/) is always an interesting experience. Drums with their instantaneous vertical lines and strings with their soaring harmonics parallel across the screen. I suggest [Ihojin no Yaiba](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8gmbWKXY_M) from Sword of the Stranger to listen to through the spectrograph: both features will be visible.
