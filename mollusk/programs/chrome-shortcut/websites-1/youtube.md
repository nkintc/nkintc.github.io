# Youtube

Here's how to get the transcript of a YouTube video \(when available\):

* Go to YouTube and open the video of your choice.
* Click on the "More actions" button \(3 horizontal dots\) located next to the Share button.
* Click "Open transcript"

Although the syntax may be a little goofy this is a pretty good solution.
