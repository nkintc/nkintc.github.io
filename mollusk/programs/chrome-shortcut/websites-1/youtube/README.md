### Incrementing by single frames

Oftentimes video editors will put in single frame hidden gems: those frame elements that will pop up on the screen for a split second and immediately disappear,  making you wonder if you even saw anything at all. For a long time I would have to click back and hope that I press the spacebar at the exact right frame in order to see what was written. However, there's an easier way: pause the video and press `,` or `.` to increment by single frames.

### Grabbing Automatic Transcripts From Video

Here's how to get the transcript of a YouTube video \(when available\):

* Go to YouTube and open the video of your choice.
* Click on the "More actions" button \(3 horizontal dots\) located next to the Share button.
* Click "Open transcript"

Although the syntax may be a little goofy this is a pretty good solution.
