  Since Chrome gets its own set of pages, might as well lump in the pages which
  Google itself makes, here.

# Google Suite Sites

This company apparently has its fingers in everything: a site to [Keep](https://keep.google.com/) notes, a personal [Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/r/customday) to manage events, [mail](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/) managed with Gmail filters, and a file [Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/) which manages version control between devices. The cost being that this is all linked to a singular account, but not everything that Google makes is hooked to an account. 

### Experiments

All For Good is a project to help people find places to lend their help. [Ngram ](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=London&year_start=1800&year_end=2019&corpus=26&smoothing=0)viewer to show trends in history; [trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/?geo=US) to show a more immediate present. [Translate](https://translate.google.com/) between languages. Explore [Arts and Culture](https://artsandculture.google.com/) around the world. [Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) to present your message. [Sites](https://sites.google.com/new) to use those fonts. 

[Experiments](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/experiments) which push the boundary of what one thinks can be done in a single webpage. [Chrome ](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/collection/chrome)has its own page. A nice example is [tendrils](https://epok.tech/work/tendrils/). Another is visualizing [higher dimensional space](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/visualizing-high-dimensional-space). [Collaboration](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/basic_features_overview.ipynb#scrollTo=odfM-_GxWbCy) via [jupyter notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ipython/ipython/blob/1.x/examples/notebooks/Cell%20Magics.ipynb) in co labs.

### Music Lab

Google's [Music Lab](https://musiclab.chromeexperiments.com/) is a chrome experiment which has a variety of instruments \(heh, instruments\) which measures and display those measurements in a meaningful way. Watching music through the [spectrogram](https://musiclab.chromeexperiments.com/Spectrogram/) is always an interesting experience. Drums with their instantaneous vertical lines and strings with their soaring harmonics parallel across the screen. I suggest [Ihojin no Yaiba](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8gmbWKXY_M) from Sword of the Stranger to listen to through the spectrograph: both features will be visible.
