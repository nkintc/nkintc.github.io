[Maze folder](http://erikdemaine.org/fonts/maze/) by Erik Demaine and his [class](http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.849/fall10/lectures/), in particular lectures [10](http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.849/fall10/lectures/L10.pdf), [20](http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.849/fall10/lectures/L20_images.pdf), [22](http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.849/fall10/lectures/L22.pdf). Guest final lecture by Tachi for [L23](http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.849/fall10/lectures/L23_images.pdf).

[Augmented square twist](http://mars.wne.edu/~thull/ast/ast.html), were a diagonal line allows it to be rigidly foldable in the [online simulator](https://origamisimulator.org/), there would no field stress. Simulator's associated [paper](http://erikdemaine.org/papers/OrigamiSimulator_Origami7/).

RabbitEar has an [npn documentation](https://rabbitear.org/docs/) which works off on a [FOLD](https://rabbitear.org/docs/graph.php) representation. Still pretty rough [online](https://beta.rabbitear.org/diagram/) work without an undo. [API ](https://svg.rabbitear.org/)works great though.
