# Responsibility

It is okay to be wrong.&#x20;

These are unedited pages. Their veracity is unverified. Some nonzero component of this brainless mass is going to have factually incorrect information. I strive to be accurate but the likelihood of perfect information is zero. Something will be amiss. The problem is that I will not know what is correct, and what is not.&#x20;

But it is okay to be wrong.&#x20;

Language is imprecise and simple words on a screen can only convey so much. Still, it is worth writing something down. It is the most bare, not even mean, contribution to the collection of human knowledge. You don't need to have a degree, you don't need to write a dissertation, you don't need to be on the bleeding edge of research. There are no requirements to contribute something of value.&#x20;

You just have to write something with meaning.&#x20;

All it takes is a common basis of knowledge to connect with someone. Maybe [not even that](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial\_intelligence).&#x20;

For example, when I write $$\hbar$$, the reduced Planck's constant likely jumped to mind without having to have mentioned any physics previously. Simply the fact, this document is in English and that quanta of electromagnetic action is traditionally represented with the variable $$h$$, being reduced by the circular frequency, or the `bar` in `hbar`, the knowledge that was already in your head jumped to the front of mind. If that little experiment worked, then the rest of this might be useful to you.&#x20;

This knowledge is not meant to be kept by me alone. It is our responsibility as [custodians, online](http://custodians.online/) to share what we know. To remember how very small this project is, here is [some sense of scale](http://stars.chromeexperiments.com/).&#x20;

Put this eloquently, "[Existence precedes essence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existence\_precedes\_essence)"  or better still...
