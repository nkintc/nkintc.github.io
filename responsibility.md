# Responsibility

It is okay to be wrong.&#x20;

These are unedited pages. Their veracity is unverified. Some significant component of this brainless mass text is going be factually incorrect. Though I strive to be accurate, the likelihood of perfect information is zero. The problem is not that I will not know what is correct and what is not because it is okay to be wrong.&#x20;

Additinally, language is imprecise and simple words on a screen can only convey so much. Still, it is worth writing something down. It is the most bare, not even mean, contribution to the collection of human knowledge. You don't need to have a degree, you don't need to write a dissertation, you don't need to be on the bleeding edge of research. There are no requirements to contribute something of value.&#x20;

You just have to write something with meaning and care. Something that represents _you_ to make something of value. All it takes is a common basis of knowledge to connect with someone. Maybe [not even that](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial\_intelligence).&#x20;

For example, when I write $$\hbar$$, the reduced Planck's constant likely jumped to mind without having to have mentioned any physics previously. Simply that you, the reader, can understand what is here makes this document valuable. If that little experiment worked, then the rest of this might be useful to you. Knowledge is not meant to be kept and hoarded. It is our responsibility as [custodians, online](http://custodians.online/) to share what we know. To remember how very small this project is, here is [some sense of scale](http://stars.chromeexperiments.com/).&#x20;

Put eloquently, "[Existence precedes essence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existence\_precedes\_essence)"  or better still...
