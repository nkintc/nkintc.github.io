# Keeping a Changelog

The template for this changelog comes from [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/). This is what I'll build it off of but no promises that there will be no changes. Some of these sections will not apply to what I do in this digital garden.&#x20;

* `Added` for new features.
* `Changed` for changes in existing functionality.
* `Deprecated` for soon-to-be removed features.
* `Removed` for now removed features.
* `Fixed` for any bug fixes.
* `Security` in case of vulnerabilities

For most of these, the Security and Deprecated sections are not going to be utilized except in the rarest circumstances.&#x20;
