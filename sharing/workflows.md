# Workflows

### Knowledge Wiki

Writing most online work in markdown files, nowadays. Using Gitbook pages to maintain revision control across machines. There are some limitations, sure. One key problem is lack of inline math, so variables as part of a sentence are a no-go. 

[Obsidian ](https://obsidian.md/features)and [Typora](https://typora.io/) are my main IDE's, per-say. Both follow FOSS, or at least the free part. They are both available on macOS, Windows, and Linux. 

### Directory Traversing

Use [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to keep track of various `.dotfiles` across machines. 

### Wishlist of Maker Products 

[Resin Printer](https://peopoly.net/products/phenom). If one could make a helmet, other cosplay parts should be easy to do as well. Having a large ultrasonic cleaner would be nice to have in cleaning resin.  

[Laser Cutter](https://glowforge.com/). Undergraduate time at Trinity had access to the glowforge. It's a really intuitive interface: etching my name into my macBook was simple.
