# Workflows

Writing most online work in markdown files, nowadays. Using Gitbook pages to maintain revision control across machines. There are some limitations, sure. One key problem is lack of inline math, so variables as part of a sentence are a no-go. 

[Obsidian ](https://obsidian.md/features)and [Typora](https://typora.io/) are my main IDE's, per say.
