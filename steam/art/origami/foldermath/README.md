There is an undeniable relationship between folds and the mathematical simplicity of lines: a discontinuity in the plane and the one-to-one relationship between two variables. With a little time and effort, any 2D graph can be represented using a crease pattern, though it is a different story if it will produce anything of meaning in the deformed configuration. The problem is how to define what that relationship is supposed to be.&#x20;
