Motivation for this project is to use a literature review to study the applications stochastic finite elements and methods to solve such problems: Markov and Monte Carlo models, use of polynomial chaos to study the propagation of variability in the system. Motivation for stochastic finite elements allow for modeling of the inherent variation between expected sample measurements and the true mean, which is immeasurable without knowing the distribution of population. Current applications of these methods include uncertainty quantification in field quantities in both fluid and solid mechanics. Theory to be studied include Karhunen-Loeve and Homogenous Chaos Expansion and their application to random processes. Literature to be studied include a paper  which explores application with sparse data. Another paper applies Spectral Stochastic Finite Element Methods \(SSFEM\) to composite structures. Paper  applies SSFEM to experimental data. Additional literature will be added to both works cited and reference as the project progresses. A finalized list will be presented with the midterm project progress report.
