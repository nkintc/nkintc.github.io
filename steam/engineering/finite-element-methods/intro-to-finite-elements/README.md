# Intro to Finite Elements



$$
F_i = K_{ij}u_j
$$

F and U are both vectors and K is a matrix.&#x20;

### Lecture 1: Linear Algebra and Notation

Finite Element Methods are suitable for nonsquare, or rectangular matrices which is a change from SM, which typically deals with square, and for that matter symmetric, matrices.&#x20;

$$
\boldsymbol{K} = \left[\begin{array}{cccc}k_{1,1} & k_{1,2} & \cdots & k_{1, m} \\k_{2,1} & k_{2,2} & \cdots & k_{2, m} \\\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\k_{n, 1} & k_{n, 2} & \cdots & k_{n, m}\end{array}\right]
$$

Vectors are like matrices but has only one value in one of the 2 dimensions so the second index is omitted

$$
{\bf a}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
a_1\\
a_2\\
a_3\\
\vdots\\
a_n
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Two special matrices, the zero matrix and the identity matrix. The zero matrix is the equivalent of identically zero in linear algebra. The identity matrix is a square matrix which has 1 along the main diagonal.&#x20;
