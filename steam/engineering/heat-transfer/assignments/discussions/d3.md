**Prompt:** Discuss time constants

**Discussion:** Time constants, $\tau$, are used to describe the response of linear ordinary differential equations \(ODE’s\), where the time rate of change of dependent variable is a function of independent variable. In layman’s terms, the “snappiness” of the response. In proper form, the linear ODE below models many equations:

$$
\tau \frac{d V}{d t}+V=f(t).
$$

The time constant is whatever constant value puts the equation into this form. This is unsatisfying. However, there is a good analogue with resistor/capacitor \(RC\) circuits, where the time constant is the product of the two values. In electronics, the resistance is a material property but here, the resistance dependent on the system geometry. For convective heat flow, $R_{conv}=\frac{1}{\overline{h} A_{s}}$: $\bar{h}$, the heat transfer coefficient; $A\_s$, the surface area through which heat may flow. The heat capacity $C$, is simply the total thermal energy the system contains which is $c\_p$, specific heat capacity, and $M$, the total mass.

$$
R C=\underbrace{\frac{\overbrace{Mc_p}^{C}}{\overline{h} A_{s}}}_{R} =\tau_{\text {lumped}}
