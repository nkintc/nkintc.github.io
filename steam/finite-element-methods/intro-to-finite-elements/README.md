# Intro to Finite Elements

### Lecture 1: Linear Algebra and Notation

Finite Element Methods are suitable for nonsquare, or rectangular matrices which is a change from SM, which typically deals with square, and for that matter symmetric, matrices. 

$$
{\bf M} 
= 
\begin{bmatrix}
M_{1,1} & M_{1,2} & M_{1,3} & M_{1,4}\\
M_{2,1} & M_{2,2} & M_{2,3} & M_{2,4}\\
M_{3,1} & M_{3,2} & M_{3,3} & M_{3,4}\\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Vectors are like matrices but has only one value in one of the 2 dimensions so the second index is omitted

$$
{\bf a}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
a_1\\
a_2\\
a_3\\
\vdots\\
a_n
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Two special matrices, the zero matrix and the identity matrix. The zero matrix is the equivalent of identically zero in linear algebra. The identity matrix is a square matrix which has 1 along the main diagonal.
