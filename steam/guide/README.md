# \[guide]

School is just the start since learning is a continuous process. Stuff that I add are mine but I need to add a wrapper to how I process learning from other people. I wish that I had developed this when I was in undergrad but those things I guess will have to be relearned. When I take a class, the collection of notes are mixed with the resources the lecturer deemed were important to the content of knowledge presented. But neither I, nor the presenter created this so we both need to attribute the original creator or at the very least, attribute who we found what we are learning.&#x20;

Until I get access to my notes again, filling out the the course notes is going to be rather difficult. I'll clean it up as best as I can until then though.&#x20;
