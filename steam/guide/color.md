# Color Theory

A variety of assorted topics:&#x20;

* On the color [brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4aWZRtTwU), which is dark orange with context.
* Representation of color betwen RBG and[ HSV ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL\_and\_HSV); [learning](http://learn.leighcotnoir.com/artspeak/elements-color/hue-value-saturation/)

Figure 3 of [Chapter 16](https://www.ecse.rpi.edu/\~schubert/Light-Emitting-Diodes-dot-org/Sample-Chapter.pdf) is approximately [normally distributed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal\_distribution): wavelengths for maximum relative sensitivity is listed on the top scale, half responses on the bottom, in nanometers.

$$
f_i(\left.\lambda\right|\sigma_i,\mu_i)=\frac{e^{-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\lambda-\mu_i}{\sigma_i}\right)^{2}}}{\sigma_i\sqrt{2 \pi}} \quad i = \{\text{blue, black, green, red}\}
$$

The expression is equal to $$1$$ for the maximum and $$0.5$$ for the annotated values.&#x20;
