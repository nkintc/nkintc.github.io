# Mathematics

Mathematics is such a broad term for what I want to cover. There are many that are broken out that should be covered under this but I digress. These are concepts based in mathematics which may or may not have practical applications in the real world. But in any case, I think that my favorite is stuff that everyone can at least be somewhat familiar with.&#x20;

A fun example is that two concepts that are taught in high school are intimately related to each other: the quadratic formula can be derived by completing the square of a generic quadratic equation.

$$
\begin{align*}
 ax^2 + bx + c &= 0 \\
 x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x + \frac{c}{a} &= 0 \\
 \left( x + \frac{b}{2a} \right )^2 - \left( \frac{b}{2a}  \right )^2 + \frac{c}{a} &= 0 \\
 \left( x + \frac{b}{2a} \right )^2 &=  \left( \frac{b}{2a}  \right )^2 - \frac{c}{a}\\
 & =  \frac{b^2-4ac}{4a^2}\\
 x + \frac{b}{2a} & = \frac{\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}
\quad\longrightarrow\quad
\boxed{x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}}
\end{align*}
$$

Even though these symbols are interchangeable, by manipulating them in the same context, the relationship between them across ideas can be illustrated more clearly. &#x20;

### Analytic Hierarchy Process&#x20;

Analytic hierarchy Process (AHP) is a method for decision making which compares the relative choices that one can make, weighs them, and then uses that to make the most informed decision. I stumbled upon during my time at LANL for EVMS and became interested in how this process works. First link that I found helpful was a [Stack Exchange page](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1272705/priority-vector-and-eigenvectors-ahp-method). &#x20;

### Metallic Numbers&#x20;

For all the fame and attention that the Golden Ratio ($$\phi \approx 1.618$$) gets in comparison to the rest of the mathematical constants, there is a whole family of constants which get left out of the picture.&#x20;

It is relatively common to know that $$\phi$$ can be represented with an algebraic representation: $$\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}=\phi.$$ But that expression generalizes to the rest of the integers!&#x20;

$$
\frac{n + \sqrt{n^2+4}}{2} \quad \forall n\in \N
