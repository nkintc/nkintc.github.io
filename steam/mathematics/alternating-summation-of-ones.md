# Alternating Summation of Ones

###

Here is a pretty common high school problem that shows the weirdness that happen with infinite series.&#x20;

$$
\text{What is the result of } 1-1+1-1+1\ldots\text{?}
$$

We want to know what the value is so set equal to some unknown, like $$\text{X}$$ and notice that it contains itself.&#x20;

$$
\begin{align*} 
& \text{X} = 1 \overbrace{ - 1 + 1 - 1 + 1-1\ldots}^{-\text{X}}\\
& \text{X} = 1 -\text{X}\\
& 2\text{X} = 1 \rightarrow \boxed{\text{X} = 1/2}
\end{align*}
$$
