# What is i^i

This is the first homework question in my Signals and Systems class.

One of the rationalizations for this is that raising a number to a complex power is equivalent to a scaling (the real component) and rotation (the imaginary component). Using Euler's Identity, then exponentiation by the base imaginary unit is equivalent to rotation by $$90\degree$$. The base number can be complex, not just real.&#x20;

So if the base number in this case is $$i$$, then it starts on the imaginary axis and rotates onto the real axis.&#x20;

$$
i^i = {\left( e^{\frac{i2}{\pi}}\right)}^i = e^{\frac{i^22}{\pi}} = e^{\frac{-2}{\pi}} = \boxed{0.2087...}
$$
