Never realized the photogrammetry was so simple. Using Meshroom and Blender and a video, it's a pretty simple process. All that Meshroom really needs is just a bunch of photos. Taking a video, collect a sampling of frames, optionally collect camera information, and meshroom will spit out an object (with texturing!).&#x20;
