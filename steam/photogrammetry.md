# Photogrammetry

Never realized the photogrammetry was so simple. Using Meshroom and Blender and a video, it's a pretty simple process. All that Meshroom really needs is just a bunch of photos. Taking a video, collect a sampling of frames, optionally collect camera information, and meshroom will spit out an object (with texturing!). Here is a youtube video of processing [Photogrammetry](https://youtu.be/AH-gUNfKapg?si=pMKs32MDN71-qiEH)
