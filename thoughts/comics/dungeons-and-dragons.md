# Dungeons and Dragons

First game of D\&D was Curse of Strahd. Joining in the middle of the campaign, my party was a group of (their words) "chucklefucks" and they most certainly lived up to that title in the best of ways.

Going into the game, I was told to not get too attached to my character. Creating a as a human Horizonwalker Ranger named Marcus, it was hard not to get attached to the character that I was building out. Starting off at level 5 to catch up, it was incredibly fun just to build out the character. Once I started playing, I immediately disregarded the advice and got attached.

This game fully depends on the interpersonal relationships of the players.&#x20;

What I dislike is being used as a story piece. This game is heavily dependent on the group of party members and the DM. With the DM, they have more influence than any one party member but collectively it is the party that drives the story progression.&#x20;
