# League of Legends

This is a great game, but incredibly toxic due to the community. Turning off all-chat is a half measure that minimizes the toxicity but also makes it more difficult to win, because it is a team game that requires communication between all players. That in itself is a difficult thing to manage between 5 strangers on Summoner's Rift.&#x20;

Additionally, it is a difficult game to pick up. The learning curve is steep and it is almost mandatory to already have people integrated in the game to help you pick it up.&#x20;
