# Death

Good news, everyone! We are all going to die someday.&#x20;

Unfortunately, we don't get to choose how. But all things that live will die, eventually. I believe that it would be a curse to live forever. ethernal youth or otherwise. It would be especially torturous if you were the only person with immortality, being forced to watch those you love age and die.

Even if we were all immortal, would it still be awful. Neglecting the societal ramifications of an ever increasing population, no person stays the same over an extended period of time. You would grow apart from your loved ones. Though you might perhaps find new people to care for, more likely than not, all would turn into uncaring recluses because why not? You would have infinite time.



> _This parrot is no more. It has ceased to be. It’s expired and gone to meet its maker. This is a late parrot. It’s a stiff. Bereft of life, it rests in peace. If you hadn’t nailed it to the perch, it would be pushing up the daisies. It’s rung down the curtain and joined the choir invisible. This is an ex-parrot_. - Monty Python Sketch, Dead Parrot&#x20;
