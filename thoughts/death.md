  Passed on, gave up the ghost, kicked the bucket, bit the dust, went to be with
  the lord, called home, croaked, took a dirt nap... died. Euphemisms to avoid
  the cold reality of the final end.

All things that live will die.&#x20;

_This parrot is no more. It has ceased to be. It’s expired and gone to meet its maker. This is a late parrot. It’s a stiff. Bereft of life, it rests in peace. If you hadn’t nailed it to the perch, it would be pushing up the daisies. It’s rung down the curtain and joined the choir invisible. This is an ex-parrot_. - Monty Python Sketch, Dead Parrot &#x20;
