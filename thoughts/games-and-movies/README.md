# Shows and Films

A friend of mine showed me a list which she keeps of all the films which she has watched: a vast and extensive list with the name and when she watched it. Though it won't be as extensive or comprehensive of as the original but below is a list of the ones which I have watched. Like the rest of the garden, it should keep growing over time. &#x20;

These tables are sorted by title, alphabetically. If you want to see by history or director, you might want to install [this extension](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42843288/is-there-any-way-to-make-markdown-tables-sortable).&#x20;
