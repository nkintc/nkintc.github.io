# Interviews

In Boy Scouts \(RIP to that organization\), I learned the EDGE framework for teaching. It is probably mangled from the brain vault 

* Educate
* Demonstrate
* Guide
* Enable

Teaching anyone how to do a task involve these sequential stages, which cannot be accomplished unless the previous step is solid.
