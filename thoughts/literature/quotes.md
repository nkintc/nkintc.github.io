Why this is up here?  Look to [Francois Clemmons on his interaction with Fred Rogers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UD7Z-O7U33c). Simple human interactions are the building blocks of society. It requires that all parties work together, because all distinctions between them are arbitrary and only serve to facilitate meaningful work. You are okay as a human being: if you are reading this, I am proud of you. These quotes are here because words have power and these collections of words might inspire. I know that they did for me. &#x20;

Note many of these came from [Mathpages](https://www.mathpages.com/home/quotes.htm). I kept the ones that resounded with me most. There is a great pair omitted with Einstein and Besso worth looking at.&#x20;
