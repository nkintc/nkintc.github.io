# Reading is Hard

As a kid, I was a voracious reader. In elementary school, the Advanced Reader (AR) program was a stimulus to read books. My third grade teacher had a board with a board with paper cartoon dog bowls with each of our names on it. By reading and taking taking tests, you could get AR points to be redeemed for prizes. I was so proud that my bowl was simply overflowing.&#x20;

As an adult, I hardly have (or make) the opportunity to read any more. Lugging around books is a hassle and I'm continuously reading the excrement of the working world (emails). Reading has become a chore. It isn't well integrated with what I do and the sudden swap from reading for work and reading for pleasure is, frankly, unpleasant.&#x20;

One of the ways that I've been getting back into reading is electronically, for all the pros and cons that method brings. Two programs are what I use: [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) and an Amazon Kindle, Paperwhite Edition. Having a dedicated digital library and digital medium to read has streamlined the process and I've  been reading more since I left high school.&#x20;
