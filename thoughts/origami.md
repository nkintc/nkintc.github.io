# Origami

Like many, I would guess, my first foray into origami was as a child. In school, we read Sadako and the Thousand Paper Cranes, a book deserving of it's own article for it's impact on my life. At the time, I did not consider the meaning of the story being told. All that I took from the book is sadness; the meaning of life and death had not been impressed on me yet.&#x20;
