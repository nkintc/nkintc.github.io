# Schooling

Finally out of education for a little while now, I've begin to realize the the impact that schooling has had on the trajectory of my life. It has imprinted a desire for knowledge and understanding of the world and _why_ things work the way that they do.&#x20;

Though it started in high school, it was the higher education that made the most lasting impact on my life. I did not sign up for my engineering degree but got lucky that I was placed there. Originally, I went for physics or mathematics but was placed in the weeder course of engineering that forced freshmen at Trinity University to find the major that would best suit them.&#x20;

But I got through it and stuck with it.&#x20;
