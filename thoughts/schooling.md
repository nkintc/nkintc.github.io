# Schooling

Finally out of education for a little while now, I've begin to realize the the impact that schooling has had on the trajectory of my life. It has imprinted a desire for knowledge and understanding of the world and _why_ things work the way that they do.&#x20;

As a kid, I loved science and math. Math mostly. Probably because:

1. Everyone else hated it and I was a hipster even as a child
2. It was fun because I was good at it&#x20;

Contrarianism aside,&#x20;





Though it started in high school, it was the higher education that made the most lasting impact on my life. I did not sign up for my engineering degree but got lucky that I was placed there. Originally, I went for physics or mathematics but was placed in the weeder course of engineering that forced freshmen at Trinity University to find the major that would best suit them.&#x20;

But I got through it and stuck with it. And learning about the science behind the impact of engineering left me curious and desiring more.&#x20;
