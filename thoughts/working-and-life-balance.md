# Working and Life Balance

My first job out of school is as a Project Engineer at Los Alamos National Laboratory. It has been an interesting experience to say the least because it has been such a unique perspective as to how the an engineering project develops over time.&#x20;

Though it has not been what I expected (at all), I cannot say that it has been unenjoyable. The people that I have gotten to work with have been amazing and the work I have been exposed to has been eye-opening. The scope of work out there to be done is broad and endlessly deep.&#x20;

### Project Engineering

The liaison between the management and implementation of facilities, requiring technical knowledge and some management skills. For large projects, this is essential for so many moving parts that otherwise would act independently and conflict. There are so many aspects to implementing new facilities and interfacing between disciplines that having a functional knowledge of all of them is essential.&#x20;

Additionally, knowing the limitations of your knowledge and when to say "I don't know" will take one much further than blindly living in the valley of ignorance of the Dunning-Kruger confidence curve. &#x20;
