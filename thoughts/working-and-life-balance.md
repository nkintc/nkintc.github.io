# Working and Life Balance

My first job out of school is as a Project Engineer at Los Alamos National Laboratory. It has been an interesting experience to say the least because it has been such a unique perspective as to how the an engineering project develops over time.&#x20;

Though it has not been what I expected (at all), I cannot say that it has been unenjoyable. The people that I have gotten to work with have been amazing and the work I have been exposed to has been eye-opening. The scope of work out there to be done is broad and endlessly deep. &#x20;
