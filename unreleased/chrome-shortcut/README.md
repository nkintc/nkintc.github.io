  Probably my most used application because I'm a degenerate that wants to spend
  my attention span on something which is constantly changing, the internet.

# Google Chrome

One of innumerable browsers to explore the internet, this page is where I'll jot down digital landmarks and other notable sites which existed at least one point on the internet. While I appreciate about this program in particular is that the setting sync between machines,  which follows the principle of replicability on the internet.  however that's due to a single Google account and It's a love-hate relationship between Google and I. As much as I enjoy their products and the services that they provide, I cannot help but think that at some point dedicating any more energy effort or most importantly money towards them would be a detriment to my overall well-being.



### Address Bar Searches

Typically the omnibar searches for a url but you can specify what you want to see on the screen

```text
data:text/html, <html contenteditable>
```

to create a scratchpad to work on.

```text
chrome://{settings,bookmarks,newtab,chrome-urls}
```

settings 

bookmarks... where i store some bookmarks temporarily

newtab: what chrome picks up and is different from new-tab-page

chrome-urls: where to find the rest of these
