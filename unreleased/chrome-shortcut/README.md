# Google Chrome

Of all the programs on all the computers which I have gotten to work with, Chrome was presented there already or I added it to use its functionality. As with any process, my personal workflow has some inertia behind it, so I'm not 

This program is generally where I waste all of my time, some of which is spent productively writing and actively thinking about projects or problems. However, sites like Reddit, Imgur, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, etc, … are also available on the internet sooooo… ¯\\_\(o.O\)\_/¯ where my eye wanders is subject to what I click on with my hands. And it's muscle memory to open a new tab and type `old.reddit.com` . 

At this point Google has pretty much everything they need to replicate me however they wish.  But the point of consumer privacy is that no one has access to all the information at once.  additionally this is the information which I want to have public anyway:  ideally it should be useful to someone else as well. Being thoughtful as to what is public and what should be private is what makes the private information valuable.

### Address Bar Searches

Typically the omnibar searches for a url but you can specify what you want to see on the screen

```text
data:text/html, <html contenteditable>
```

to create a scratchpad to work on.

```text
chrome://{settings,bookmarks,newtab,chrome-urls}
```

settings 

bookmarks... where i store some bookmarks temporarily

newtab: what chrome picks up and is different from new-tab-page

chrome-urls: where to find the rest of these
