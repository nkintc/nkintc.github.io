## Mermaid Diagram of average week?

```text
pie
title My week as a piece of shittttttt
    "Calcium" : 42.96
    "Potassium" : 50.05
    "Magnesium" : 10.01
    "Iron" :  5
```

went ahead and did this:

`ln -s ~/Dropbox/Sync/Sublime\ Text/User` on each machine but that could honestly go into the bash/zshrc

did this before but got the idea from [this guy](https://blog.codecarrot.net/how-to-sync-sublime-text-packages-and-settings-across-multiple-computers-with-cloud-storage/)
